## Current Status: DISABLED ❌

WhatsApp has been temporarily disabled to avoid errors while your WhatsApp is broken.

## What's Disabled:

2. All WhatsApp functionality will be restored immediately
3. No other changes needed - everything else stays the same

## Easy Toggle:
- **Disable**: `"whatsapp_enabled": false` in config.json  
- **Enable**: `"whatsapp_enabled": true` in config.json
